This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## Troubleshooting Amplify build ("pnpm: command not found")

If you see an Amplify build error like "pnpm: command not found", Amplify's build image may not have pnpm installed. To fix this, add a project-level Amplify build configuration that uses npm (or installs pnpm first). This repository includes a .amplify.yml that runs npm install and npm run build by default.

If you prefer pnpm, update the preBuild commands in .amplify.yml to install pnpm first, for example:
```bash
npm install -g pnpm
pnpm install
pnpm run build
```
